  Natural language processing (NLP) products focus on translating written or spoken human language into structured data such as rows and columns in a database or spreadsheet.  For example, if you were to press a button on your smartphone that invokes a virtual assistant and say: "What is the weather going to be like this afternoon", natural language processing would derive the data necessary from that question to be able to query a structured data set containing weather data.
