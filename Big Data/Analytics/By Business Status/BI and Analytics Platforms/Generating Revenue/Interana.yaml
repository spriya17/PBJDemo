    Interana is the fast and scalable event-based analytics solution to answer critical business questions about how customers behave and products are used. Interana allows users to analyze and explore the key business metrics that matter most in a data-driven world - such as growth, retention, conversion and engagement - in seconds, rather than the hours or days it often takes with existing solutions. Interana allows customers to discover and investigate these key insights easily through its visual and interactive interface, which makes data analysis a natural extension of everyone's workflow.
    
    Interana is a full stack software solution that is deployed for you in a dedicated cloud environment. While you're going to love Interana for its interactive visual experience, what makes that happen is some of the deepest innovation that's ever been brought to processing event data at scale.
    
    Pick a visualization, time range, and a set of measurements. Compare time periods and other groupings. Slice and dice by anything in your original data, as well as actor segmentation, and funnel and session metrics that you can ask Interana to compute on-the-fly. Typehead helps you as you go. Breadcrumbs make sure you don't get lost.
    
    Interana is built to be blindingly fast and massively scalable at processing any kind of question directly against the raw records. There's nothing like it. Interana can process queries over months of data on the busiest digital services in seconds or less.
    
    Only Interana is:

    + Visual, intuitive and interactive, encouraging iterative exploration
    + For digital economy workers of all kinds, not just coders and data scientists
    + Fast, fixable and scalable to massive volumes of raw events and huge actor populations
    + Built for behavioral questions, not just simple statistics
    + Universal to any kind of digital service, not just mobile or web
    + Full-stack software from data persistence to query processing to visualization
