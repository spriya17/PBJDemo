At Guavus, they fundamentally believe that in order for businesses to become truly data-driven enterprises there needs to be a new model for analyzing the massive petabytes of data that are being generated on networks and through sensor devices. A new data fabric that correlates and analyzes the data as it hits the network. By enabling enterprises to analyze data the instant it's captured, Guavus gives businesses the unique ability to be decisive in today's data-driven world.
    
    The Guavus Reflex platform was built from the ground up to address the size and velocity of streaming and business data being generated from the world's biggest networks. Guavus Reflex's unique "analyze-first, store-later" model provides customers the ability to collect, correlate and fuse network business and any other operational or external data revealing previously undiscoverable insights in real time. 
    
    Guavus has always been at the forefront of big data analytics innovation, leveraging the latest Open Source analytics technologies, including Apache Hadoop, Spark and Yarn at its core, to deliver a carrier-grade, scalable, low-latency, highly distributed platform.
