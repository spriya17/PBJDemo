    Adrcadia Data was founded with the singular mission to connect business users to Hadoop. The Arcadia Converged Analytics Platform unifies visual exploration and back-end data analytics in one integrated enterprise platform that runs natively on the Hadoop cluster. 
    
    Arcadia converges the visual, analytics and data layers to provide accelerated access to all of the data stored within Hadoop, and support net-new analytics on granular datasets.
    
    Key features of Arcadia Data's solution are:

    + No Coding Required. No need to start by building datamarts/cubes. Go straight into big data with intuitive drag-and drop self-service interface provides exploration and semantic modeling on breadth and depth of all your data.
    + Connect, Explore, Join. Work with data across multiple sources: Hive, Impala, Postgres, Amazon Redshift, MySQL, Teradata Aster, and more. Join tables and define semantic models on data sets for virtual data marts on data-in-place.
    + Flexible Visual Builder. Work from a broad set of flexible, customizable visuals, and embed and customize hundreds of D3 Javascript visuals in any browser-based application.
    + Self-Optimizing Data Store. Arcadia's unique Active Data Store models and tunes data structures continuously, at Hadoop scale. It automatically replaces sub-optimal curated schemas with intent-driven models across a broad range of BI and visualization use cases.
    + Customization and Embeddablity. Complete control over visual stylization of your own browser-based data applications using a standards-based API for CSS and Javascript extension.
    + Data Blending Across Sources. In just a few clicks, set up exploratory visuals and use them to create rich navigation-enabled applications.
    + On-Cluster Security. Native on-cluster security with role-based access control provides security on data in place directly on Hadoop clusters, without sacrificing granular access control down to individual rows and columns.
    + Advanced Analytics. No coding required to leverage Hadoop-driven on-cluster execution to power advanced visualizations such as granular path analysis, flow and funnel algorithms, behavior-based segmentation and dimension/measure correlations.
