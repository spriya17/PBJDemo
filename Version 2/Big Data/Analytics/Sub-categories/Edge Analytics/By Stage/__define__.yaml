description: |
  Edge analytics solutions offer an automated analytical computation performed on data at the point of generation - a sensor, network switch or other "edge" device, instead of sending the data to a centralized data store, processing, analyzing, and then receiving the insight based on which some action has to be performed at the "edge". Analyzing data in real-time, close to the source ensures continuous operational efficiency and scalability.
