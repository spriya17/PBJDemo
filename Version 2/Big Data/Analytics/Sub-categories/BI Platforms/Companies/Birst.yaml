    Birst is a truly next generation platform for enterprise BI and analytics. Birst is the only enterprise business intelligence platform that connects together the entire organization through a network of interwoven virtualized BI instances on-top a shared common analytical fabric. 
    
    Birst enterprise BI delivers the speed, self-service, and agility front-line business workers demand, and the scale, security, and control to meet rigorous corporate data standards. Birst delivers all of this and much more with low TCO via public or private cloud configurations.
    
    Birst's Networked BI platform redefines the way BI is delivered and consumed, eliminating analytical silos to dramatically improve the speed, alignment and economics of BI across the enterprise. Built on top of Birst's next-generation, multi-tenant cloud architecture, Networked BI enables centralized and decentralized BI applications to be transparently connected via a shared analytical data fabric, delivering local execution with global governance.
    
    Birst's unique architecture automates the process of unifying and refining all data from any source across the enterprise. Birst leverages intelligent unification technologies that can both map and model data from multiple different sources. Birst Automated Data Refinement (ADR) refines data to create a Unified Business Model - or a "Business-ready Data Tier" - that everyone can trust. Birst ensures that user-generated data and analysis remains consistent with your centralized enterprise data stores, extending data governance and control throughout your enterprise.
    
    Birst allows you to manipulate data with ease. Birst's fully responsive and integrated HTML5 dashboards and visual discovery interfaces unifies traditional separate dashboard and discovery interfaces. Birst's visual discovery interface offers the ability to intuitively explore data with consumer-friendly features like drag-and-drop and double-click, auto-complete search, guided visualizations, and visual filtering.
    
    Birst Mobile BI allows you to access data from any device, anywhere. Birst mobile leverages the exact same HTML5 interface used in Birst on desktop, laptop or any other device. Business users on the go can quickly flick through charts and tables, filter information, and drill into reports for more detail.
