	Teradata is an enterprise software company that develops and sells a relational database management system (RDBMS) with the same name. Teradata is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the stock symbol TDC.

	The Teradata product is referred to as a "data warehouse system" and stores and manages data. The data warehouses use a "shared nothing" architecture, which means that each server node has its own memory and processing power. Adding more servers and nodes increases the amount of data that can be stored. The database software sits on top of the servers and spreads the workload among them. Teradata has added text analytics to track unstructured data, such as word processor documents, and semi-structured data, such as spreadsheets.
