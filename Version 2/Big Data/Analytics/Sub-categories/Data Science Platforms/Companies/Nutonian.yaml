    Nutonian is industrializing data science with the world's smartest modeling application.
    
    Nutonian's flagship application, Eureqa, accelerates discovery and understanding by making data science and artificial intelligence accessible to all business users. The company's dynamic modeling engine evolves billions of potential solutions per seconds, and identifies the best to predict and explain future events. 
    
    Eureqa was intended to address the two biggest scarcities in data science: people and time. Contemporary business intelligence, modeling, and machine learning tools rely on technically sophisticated individuals to glean insights by manually creating, validating, and interpreting analytical models to determine next best actions for business. The result is slow time-to-answer cycles and lost revenue.
    
    Eureqa is a proprietary A.I.-powered modeling engine that automates much of the heavy lifting inherent in analytics and data science. Leveraging automated evolutionary algorithms, Eureqa churns through your data to create accurate predictive models in minutes rather than months.
    
    Eureqa's UI is as intuitive and elegant as any leading visualization tool, and its flexible Python API allows more advanced users to integrate Eureqa into their existing data science workflows.
    
    Some of Eureqa's key features include:

    + Infinite Scalability. Tap into unlimited CPU resources to linearly scale compute and accelerate data science projects, without having to provision new hardware or administer cloud servers.
    + Lightning fast solutions. Experience awe-inspiring performance, as Eureqa tests billions of potential models per second to identify those that best fit your data.
    + Automatic signal discovery. Automatically capture, combine, or transform important variables into features. Shit the focus from "big data" to the "right data."
    + Shareable results. Share data and model outputs within team-based or business-wide environment.
    + Take action with confidence. Leverage transparent results and interactive visualizations to choose the best course of action.
    + Default best practices. Utilize modeling best practices with Eureqa's default template, or use the advanced settings to customize analyses.
    + Exceptional accuracy. Tested against common machine learning algorithms. Eureqa finds more accurate models in less time.
    + Industry-specific solutions. Automate the entire workflow at the push of a button.
    + API access. Tap directly into live data streams, interface with visualization tools, and integrate with existing analyses in Python, R, Excel, MATLAB, and SAS.
