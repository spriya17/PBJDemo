Plus, build custom apps quickly with powerful design tools and use APIs to connect to proprietary data sources and system in real-time. While Domo are proud proponents of the cloud, they recognize it poses challenges to some organizations. In situations where contractual or regulatory circumstances require data to be contained behind a firewall or in an existing data warehouse, Domo has you covered there too.
    
    Whether you're a startup with 50 users or an enterprise firm with 50,000, the Business Cloud scales to meet your needs. And because The Business Cloud is an open system platform, it's not constrained to one specific model or deployment methodology. The Business Cloud has powerful acquisition solutions that bring in your relevant data, no matter where it's stored. And once the data is in Domo, dynamic ETL tools help users of any skill level get it ready for visualization.
    
    Domo's solutions are suitable for many industries, including Education, Financial Services, Healthcare, High Tech, Hospitality & Transportation, Manufacturing, Media & Entertainment, Professional Services, and Retail & e-Commerce.
