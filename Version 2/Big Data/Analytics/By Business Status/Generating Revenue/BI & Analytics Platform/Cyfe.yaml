    Cyfe Dashboard is an online dashboard platform for building real-time business dashboards. Cyfe provides a browser-based dashboard that allows business users to connect to many data services, automate data retrieval, analyze, and then transform and visualize the data for business intelligence. The product targeted non-technical end user by providing them a schema-less architecture to easily connect to data sources, and separates data from presentation and reuse data sources throughout the platform.

Users are able to access the dashboard from their desktop, tablet and mobile phone, and share it with others by granting access to the dashboard.
