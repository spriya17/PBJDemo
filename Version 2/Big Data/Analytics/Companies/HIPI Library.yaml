    HIPI Library

description: |

  HIPI is an image processing library designed to be used with the Apache Hadoop MapReduce parallel programming framework. HIPI facilitates efficient and high-throughput image processing with MapReduce style parallel programs typically executed on a cluster. It provides a solution for how to store a large collection of images on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and make them available for efficient distributed processing. HIPI also provides integration with OpenCV, a popular open-source library that contains many computer vision algorithms (see covar example program to learn more about this integration).

  HIPI is developed and maintained by a growing number of developers from around the world.
