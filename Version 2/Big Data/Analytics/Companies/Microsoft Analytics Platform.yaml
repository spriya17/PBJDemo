    Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computer and services.
    
    Microsoft Analytics Platform offers breakthrough performance for analytics at an industry leading price. It can meet the demands of your evolving data warehouse environment with its scale-out, massively parallel processing integrated system supporting hybrid data warehouse scenarios. It provides the ability to query across relational and non-relational data by leveraging Microsoft PolyBase and industry-leading big data technologies. It offers the lowest price per terabyte for large data warehouse workloads.
    
    Microsoft Analytics Platform's advantages are:

    + Enterprise-ready Big Data. Polybase enables users to easily query non-relational and relational data using T-SQL, without interesting in Hadoop-based skills or training. With PolyBase, organizations can take advantage of flexible hybrid Hadoop solutions and query across HortonWorks, Cloudera, and even into the cloud with Microsoft Azure HDInsight.
    + Next-generation performance at scale. With true scale-out architecture, APS is one of the most powerful distributed computing and scale-out systems on the market. As an organization's need for compute or storage grows, they can simply add more resources to scale up to 6 petabytes. Additionally, they can eliminate common data warehouse bottlenecks with the MPP capabilities and parallel execution.
    + Engineered for optimal value. Microsoft streamlines the hardware footprint and optimizes value for the modern data warehouse investment. Windows Server reduces cost through Storage Spaces by allowing SAN levels of performance with commodity storage drives. In-Memory Columnstore helps organizations reduce storage usage by up to 70 percent. As a result of these innovations, Analytics Platform System offers the lowest price per terabyte in the industry for a relational data warehouse appliance.
