    Used by more than 9,000 active users, Loggly takes the important but non-differentiating work (i.e. performance tuning, error monitoring, etc.) off of their customer's hands so they can focus on innovation. 
    
    Loggly helps cloud-centric organizations solve operational problems faster. Period. If something, breaks, Loggly will tell you what. If you push a new code, Loggly will tell you if everything is ok. Stick with Loggly and they'll help you get through any log management issues you may be facing.
    
    Loggly reveals what matter. It offers a cloud-based service that mines tons of log data in real time and reveals what matters, so that you have the insights you need to produce quality code and deliver a great user experience.
    
    Some of the features and benefits of Loggly are:

    + Agentless Log Collection That Handles Unpredictable Voluems. Loggly collects your log data using existing open standards like syslog and HTTP instead of forcing you to install heavy, proprietary collection agents on every machine.
    + Intelligence Injected into Your Logs During Ingestion. Loggly automatically parses many common log types during ingestion and enables you to define your own derived fields to add structure and context to any log.
    + Sophisticated Guided Search and Analysis. All of your users gain access to a rich, term-by-term index that continuously refreshes itself as your applications generate logs and as users filter in on data. Loggly does the time-consuming work cataloging your log data long before your users need it, allowing for the delivery of instant results when requested.
    + Monitoring, Real-Time Alerts and Anomaly Detection. You'll have all the tools you need to be the first to know about potential problems. As a result, you can lessen their impact on customers and even prevent them from affecting the user experience.
    + Integration with Your DevOps Workflows. Collaborate with your team on problem solving and integrate log analysis into their key DevOps workflows.
    + Security. The security and privacy of your data is critically important to Loggly since you are placing your trusted in their services. Loggly wants you to know that they've implemented security measures and operational processes using industry best standards to protect your data today and into the future.
