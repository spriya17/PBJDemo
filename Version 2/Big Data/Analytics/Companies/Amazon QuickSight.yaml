    Starting at $9 per user per month, Quicksight is 1/10th of the cost of traditional BI solutions with no upfront investments, no expensive hardware to purchase or infrastructure to manage, and no additional license or maintenance cost.
    
    Some of the key features of QuickSight are:

    + Choose your data source. You can upload CSV or Excel files; ingest data from AWS data sources such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Athena, Amazon S3; connect to databases like SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, in the cloud or on-premises; or connect to SaaS applications like Salesforce.
    + SOICE - The Supper-fast, Parallel, In-memory, Calculation Engine. Built from the ground up for the cloud, SPICE uses a combination of columnar storage, in-memory technologies enabled through the latest hardware innovations, machine code generation, and data compression to allow users to run interactive queries on large datasets and get rapid responses.
    + Smart Visualizations. QuickSight comes with a built-in suggestion engine that provides you with recommended visualizations based on the properties of the underlying datasets.
    + Use anytime, anywhere. Drill-down on your charts, graphs, and dashboards from your web browsers or the QuickSight iPhone app. Look for Android and tablet support, including viewing in offline mode in future releases.
    + Share and Collaborate. Quicksight allows you to easily share business insights by packaging them up as interactive stories that you can share with others.
    + Integrate with popular BI tools. Future releases will allow you to use your familiar AWS partner BI solutions - including Domo, Tableau, and Qlik.
