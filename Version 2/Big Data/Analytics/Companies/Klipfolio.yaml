Klipfolio Dashboard is a cost-effective, flexible solution that integrates with 1000s of data services to create powerful business dashboards. With customers in healthcare, financial services, consumer packaged goods, non-profit, and marketing, Klipfolio is changing the way data is used one dashboard at a time.
  
  You can build just about any type of dashboard you want with Klipfolio. Here are some examples of what their customers have built:
  
  + Marketing Dashboard. Today's digital marketer is one part creative maverick, one part data nerd, and one part techie. A marketing dashboard is where these skills coalesce to impress the heck out of your team. You have the ability to tell the story of your performance using data from virtually every service you use.
  + Sales Dashboard. Sales teams today rely on data from so many different places that it's difficult to get a clear view of the things that matter. From CRMs, to Social Media, to call-tracking metrics, having a consolidated view into key performance metrics can allow data-driven teams to analyze every lead, every win, and every opportunity, and adjust accordingly.
  + Startup Dashboard. Startups live and die by metrics like Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), User Retention, and Cost to Acquire Customers (CAC). The right dashboard lets startup founders keep up-to-the minute on these metrics and stay focused on growing their business.
  + Reporting Dashboard. As a business analyst, you need to create reports and dashboards from endpoints like Excel, SQL databases, FTP/SFTP, and internal services. This example shows how these services can be combined to create custom dashboards.
  + Social Media Dashboard. Your objective as a social media marketer is to drive customer engagement, connect with your audience, and get more people talking about your brand. To run a successful social media campaign, you need to constantly measure the impact of each interaction and frame that data within the larger context of your brand's performance. A social media dashboard helps you get the answers to these questions by putting data from each of your profiles in a single place right beside other key marketing metrics.
