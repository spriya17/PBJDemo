    SolarWinds acquired Librato in Jan 2015. SolarWinds is a company which develops information technology infrastructure management software.
    
    Liberto provides a complete solution for monitoring and understanding the metrics that impact your business at all levels of the stack. Liberto provides everything you need to visualize, analyze, and actively alert on the metrics that matter to you.
    
    Leveraging their heritage in distributed systems and scalable web applications, the engineering team has built a resilient and scalable platform optimized for time series data analytics, thereby turning a complex problem into an easy to use service.
    
    Liberto's solutions offers many features and benefits, including:

    + Wire up Turn-Key Integrations. If you run AWS, Heroku, Collectd, or AppHarbor, Liberto's turn-key integrations can take you from zero visibility to full-populated dashboard in under 5 minutes.
    + Control your collectors. Liberto works with the community to support the open-source collectors you're already using. No Proprietary agent required.
    + Gain insight with mathematical transforms. Liberto's functional DSL can apply mathematical transforms to any combination of your time series. 
    + Overlay time-shifted data. Compare the past to the present, and easily track disparities between the same metrics over a series of days or weeks.
    + Don't average your data into oblivion. Liberto persists your metrics in a verbose data format that allows you to select a consolidation function when you draw the graph.
    + Create any visual correlation. Craft instruments that contain metrics from any source at any level of the stack, from SNMP byte counters on your switches to in-process instrumentation in your production apps.
    + Document and overlay arbitrary incidents. Track and cor-relate aperiodic events you define. Overlay alert notifications, cron-job runs, code-deployments, and more using annotation streams that can be superimposed on any graph.
    + Customize and share your dashboards. Craft a dashboard for each application that contains exactly the data you need to verify that your processes are happy.
    + Alert on missing data. Liberto will keep you in the loop if one of your sources has stopped sending data.
    + Craft complex alert conditions. Set up alerts based on multiple metrics and complex calculations like derivatives to capture exactly the situation about which you want to be notified.
