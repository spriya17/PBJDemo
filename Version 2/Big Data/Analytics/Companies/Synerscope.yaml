  SynerScope pioneers the next class of fast and flexible sense-making technology for the Hadoop era. Synerscope provides customers an out-of-the box system, and integrate a best-of-breed solution stack with own software that also links easily with the IT infrastructure already present. SynerScope helps to leverage ALL internal data and systems, and eases the integration with any external data sources. Synerscope delivers their customers business value within weeks of the first deployment where traditional Big Data approaches would require many months to first insights.  SynerScope's performance builds on the use of latest hardware technology, partnered with IBM Power8, Dell and Nvidia. The solution is available as an appliance or alternatively from the cloud.

  SynerScope's  "Human in-the-loop" analytics is supported by powerful software that brings enterprises and organizations high-performance compute on data types of any kind, in any combination. The high speed interlinked visualizations on data types like numbers, text, maps, network graphics, IoT and camera images put serious demands on the flexibility of the back-end. SynerScope tested more than 45 database technologies and today works with multiple Big Data technologies like MongoDB, Hortonworks Data Platform and Apache Spark on YARN.
