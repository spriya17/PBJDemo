    With AtScale, you can put the power of your Big Data in the hands of business users. Empower IT and Business Analysts alike with self-service analytics, on big data, with all the performance and scale, and without comprising security or control.
    
    AtScale bridges the gap between business users and their data. The average enterprise sits on a mountain of data that business users could use to drive better performance. Unfortunately, most enterprises are not equipped to gain value out of their data: according to Forrester, close to 75% of the data stored within an enterprise goes unused.
    
    With AtScale, data stays right where it landed, eliminating the cost, latency and complexity that comes with moving data. AtScale makes just about any BI tool scream on Hadoop. Now business users can use the tools they already know and love on Hadoop. AtScale Virtual Cubes deliver a single semantic layer, providing consistency, fast performance, and data governance regardless of the type of access.
    
    With AtScale, the dream of Business Intelligence on Big Data is a reality. You can reduce the complexity of traditional approaches by eliminating the need for data movement or tool-specific data modes. And AtScale's multi-compliant interface allows business users to leverage their existing BI tools while providing direct, secure, and interactive access to data in Hadoop and other Big Data Platforms.
