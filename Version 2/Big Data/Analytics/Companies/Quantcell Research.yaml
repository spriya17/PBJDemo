    QuantCell Research is a software company focused on software and services for Big Data and Deep Analytics. The QuantCell product is an end-user programming environment that enables data scientists, researchers and analysts in business and science to build and deploy highly advanced and visually rich analytical models and applications faster and cheaper and with less reliance on IT.
    
    QuantCell is a big data spreadsheet and an end-user programming tool. It improves turnaround time and enables SMEs to benefit from big data. It enables non-developers to build complex analysis, models and applications, and it brings the capabilities of major programming languages to the spreadsheet user.
    
    QuantCell supports real time Big Data frameworks and Apache Hadoop installations. It allows you to build MapReduce analysis or submit real time Apache Spark queries right from the spreadsheet, submit it to a Hadoop server and watch it hack away. The results can be delivered back to the spreadsheet for further analysis and visualization.
    
    QuantCell derives its powerful analytical and computational capabilities from SQL, R, Java and other platforms and from the world's largest ecosystem of computational solutions available in these languages. It delivers intuitive access to thousands of libraries and tools brought right into the spreadsheet from online repositories.
    
    For compute intensive tasks, QuantCell utilizes private and public clouds, Hadoop installations, Amazon Web Services and other HPC systems. When running locally QuantCell is as fast as Java, with no loss in performance. It brings the Java computational platform, garbage collection, multithreading, concurrency and more to spreadsheet user.
    
    QuantCell delivers rich visualization built into the spreadsheet interface. It supports visualization tools, data viewers and graphing APIs that already exist in the available ecosystem of solutions. Many of the visualization tools deliver their own analytical processing features that enhance the capabilities of QuantCell.
    
    QuantCell is for users that are domain experts in their field, data scientists, quants, analysts and researchers as well as consumers of the analysis (decision makers, managers). QuantCell is also for developers since it enables the developer to rapidly prototype solutions by eliminating user interface design, being expression based and producing deployable solution.
